# 💰 Compound Interest Calculator

A simple and interactive **Compound Interest Calculator** built using vanilla web technologies.  
It allows users to calculate how their money grows over time with configurable interest rates and compounding frequency.

The project focuses on clarity, correctness, and transparency — both in the math and in the user interface.

## 🧠 Formula Used

The calculator uses the standard compound interest formula:

A = P × (1 + r / n)n × t

Where:

- **P** = Principal amount  
- **r** = Annual interest rate (in decimal form, e.g. 8% → 0.08)  
- **n** = Number of times interest is compounded per year  
- **t** = Time in years  
- **A** = Final amount

> ⚠️ Results are approximate due to floating-point arithmetic and rounding.
